# Study Smart

Study Smart is a mobile app that I developed in part to learn mobile development with React Native, and also to help me stick to my study schedules. 

The app is equipped with a Pomodoro timer as well as the ability to create specific study schedules for multiple different subjects. The app will send you a notification when it is time to study, and will schedule Pomodoro-style study periods and breaks accordingly.
